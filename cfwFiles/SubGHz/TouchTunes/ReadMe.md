This is the repository for what hopefully will become the Flipper Zero TouchTunes. 

Pin folder contains the remote signals broken out by admin code.
Typically most locations do not change the default 000 pin, so i would start there unless you already know the pin.

If you do not know the pin, or it is not the default 000, the files in the brute/ directory should work to brute force the pin on each transmission.

Credit to https://github.com/notpike for laying the initial foundation for the TouchTunes Yardstick one app, which then became a Portapack HackRF app as well as a Goodwatch app.


If some of these generated files do not work, try the raw captures in 
the raw directory
You can also try the TouchTunes remote beta Jukebox app for the Flipper Zero.
