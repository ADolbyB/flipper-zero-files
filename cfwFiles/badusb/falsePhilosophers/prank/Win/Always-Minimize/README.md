# Always Minimize
Minimizing all opened window within specific time/delay. It's a **loop** process, that means this script won't end until you stop it.

## Config
If you want to change the delay, you can change here :

![Delay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LyQuid12/usbrubberducky-payloads/master/payloads/library/prank/Always-Minimize/images/delay.PNG)

Default is 2 seconds. 1 Second = 1000 Miliseconds.
If you set a delay less than 1 second, you literally a bastard :]
