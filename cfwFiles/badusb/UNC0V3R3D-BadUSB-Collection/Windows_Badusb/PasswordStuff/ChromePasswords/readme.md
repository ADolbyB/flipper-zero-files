Grabs the "key" and "login data" file for google chrome and sends them to a discord webhook. To decrypt please read below.

## How to use?

Well this script is kind of plug and play. After the two files ("encryped passwords" and "key.txt") got sent to your webhook, you will have to decrypt the passwords.

To do this, I have coded a python program that will use the grabbed "key" to decrypt the passwords.
