# Flipper Zero Files

This is a collection of files that I cleaned up and organized for use with the Flipper Zero device.
The files that I did not create myself were gathered from sources I have listed here.
The idea here is that one folder contains all file relevent to the FZ device that can be dropped onto the SD card, and all other files have been deleted or located in a separate folder.
