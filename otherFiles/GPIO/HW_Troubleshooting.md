Issues with stripped screws appears to be common. Be careful and use a quality screwdriver and/or bits!<br>
If you need to replace a screw, [here are the dimensions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57457139/174870632-501c9aad-ded6-46b5-8618-ba4aa8efa1e4.png) of them for replacement. (Told they are Torx M1.8 x 9mm or any "1.7x8 self-tapping".)
