![Build status](https://github.com/instantiator/flipper-zero-experimental-apps/actions/workflows/build-resistors.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

A simple app to calculate resistance from the coloured bands. See: 

* [video](https://github.com/instantiator/flipper-zero-experimental-apps/blob/main/resistors/v1.1/resistors-app-v1.1-video.mov?raw=true)

* Pick from 3, 4, 5, or 6 band resistor.
* Left and right to move the current focus, up and down to adjust the coloured bands.
* Resistance, tolerance, and temperature coefficient are updated instantly.
