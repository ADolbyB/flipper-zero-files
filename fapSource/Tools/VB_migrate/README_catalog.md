## Background
The Vital Bracelet Arena app is going to be the new companion app for the Vital
Bracelet series of fitness bracelet toys, however the app does not support
account linking from VB Lab and VBC Lab, and requires you to transfer characters
one by one from those apps through your Vital Bracelet. Because the Vital
Bracelet can only hold at most two characters at a time and requires inserting
Dim/VBM to complete the transfer, transferring all of your characters may take a
significant amount of time. The VB Lab Migration Assistant is designed to make
this process faster by allowing you to store an unlimited amount of characters
on the Flipper and to bypass the Dim loading process, therefore allowing you to
transfer your characters without having to flip back and forth between the apps
or wasting time loading data that will never be used.
