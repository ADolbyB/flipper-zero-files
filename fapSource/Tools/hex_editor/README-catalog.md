The HEX Editor app allows you to edit files directly on your Flipper Zero without connecting using your computer or smartphone. This app might be very useful for editing NFC files, similar to the Edit Dump feature.

Run the app on your Flipper Zero and select the file you want to edit. The app displays the first line of the text file. To select the desired character, use the Left and Right buttons. To replace the character, press the Ok button. To navigate through lines, use the Up and Down buttons.
