// FROM sha2.h:
/*
 * BYTE_ORDER NOTE:
 *
 * Please make sure that your system defines BYTE_ORDER.  If your
 * architecture is little-endian, make sure it also defines
 * LITTLE_ENDIAN and that the two (BYTE_ORDER and LITTLE_ENDIAN) are
 * equivalent.
 *
 * If your system does not define the above, then you can do so by
 * hand like this:
 *
 *   #define LITTLE_ENDIAN 1234
 *   #define BIG_ENDIAN    4321
 *
 * And for little-endian machines, add:
 *
 *   #define BYTE_ORDER LITTLE_ENDIAN
 *
 * Or for big-endian machines:
 *
 *   #define BYTE_ORDER BIG_ENDIAN
 *
 * The FreeBSD machine this was written on defines BYTE_ORDER
 * appropriately by including <sys/types.h> (which in turn includes
 * <machine/endian.h> where the appropriate definitions are actually
 * made).
