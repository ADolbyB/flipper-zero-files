# Doom Flipper Zero edition
## Will it run Doom?
As tradition goes, Doom is being ported to almost every possible embedded electronic device. Therefore I did an attempt to come up with something close to Doom and still compatible on the Flipper Zero's hardware. This is not the actual Doom game but a port made from yet another Doom port to the Arduino Nano - https://github.com/daveruiz/doom-nano/. This port is basically a raycasting engine, using Doom sprites.
This version is very basic and might be improved over time.
