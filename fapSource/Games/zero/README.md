## About ZERO!

ZERO! is a card game where the aim is to get rid of all your cards before your opponents! The game implements the rules of the classic card game UNO, with adaptations to make it playable on the Flipper Zero.

## Rules:

1. Players must match the card in the discard pile by either suit, number or action.
2. If a player has no matching card, they must draw a card from the deck. That card can be played if it matches the discard pile. Otherwise, the turn passes to the next player.
3. If a player has no cards left, they win the game.
4. Action cards produce a special effect when played:
   - The X card skips the next player's turn.
   - The Invert card changes the direction of play.
   - The ++ card makes the next player draw 2 cards and skip their turn.
   - The joker card allows the player to choose the suit to be matched next.
   - The ++joker++ card allows the player to choose the suit to be matched next and makes the next player draw 4 cards and skip their turn.
