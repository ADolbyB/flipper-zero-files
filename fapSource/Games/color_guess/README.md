## What this is?
As a web developer I enjoy guessing colours by HEX Code. This game is targeted at other Devs and graphic designers<br>
that also enjoy this. 
<br><br>

### Mode 1
The LED will display a color and you must try and guess it by adjusting the HEX values on the screen. A timer will show<br>
how fast you were. Three levels of difficulty are available. Vibro hints given to help you find the solution. 

### Mode 2
You can define a color using the HEX code on-screen and the LED will display this color
