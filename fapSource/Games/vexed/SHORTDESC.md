Vexed is puzzle game, where your goal is to clear level from bricks in in smallest possible count of moves. Easy to learn, **hard to master**

Originally developed for Palm.OS by James McCombe, and later extended by The Vexed Project, was abandonware since 2006. After 18 years, this full remake shares same level sets, but is written from scratch to fit on Flipper Zero 128x64 B&W screen and be controlled without touch screen.
