## About Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic variant of Tic-Tac-Toe where you have 9 Tic-Tac-Toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid. The aim of the game is to win more small boards (3x3) to ultimately win the large board (3x3 of Boards).

## Rules:

1. The first player can place their piece anywhere on the large board.
2. Your move determines the board where your opponent will make their next move. For example, if you place your piece in the top-right corner of a small board, your opponent must play in the top-right board. If your opponent then places their piece in the bottom-left corner of that board, you must now play in the bottom-left board.
3. Small boards follow the same rules as regular Tic-Tac-Toe. You must get 3 in a row to win the small board.
4. If your opponent sends you to a board that's already been won, you can choose any open spot on the entire board for your next move.
5. The winner is the first player to win 3 small boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
6. If all 9 small boards are filled and no player has won 3 small boards in a row, the game is a draw.
