# Flipper Game Boy Game Link Cable API
Simple API that can be included in projects to provide a flexible and easy way to handle data exchange over a Game Link Cable.

Current Version: 0.5

Available from: https://github.com/kbembedded/flipper-gblink


## Current feature status and future roadmap:
- [x] Ability to use EXT clock source. i.e. connected device drives the clock line  
- [x] Callback on byte transfer completion  
- [x] Flexibility in IO pin selection at alloc time  
- [x] Ability to enable and disable interrupt on input clock  
- [x] Ability to set timeout in microseconds between clock edges. If exceeded, it is assumed the next clock is the first bit of a byte
- [x] Set a NO\_DATA\_BYTE pattern. i.e. after a byte transfer is complete, a default byte is prepared to be sent out if no new data is provided before the transfer starts  
- [x] Supports communication to GBC
- [x] Supports communication to GBA using GBC games
- [ ] Supports communication to GB (untested, but should work)
- [ ] Supports communication to GBA using GBA games
- [ ] Function as INT clock source. i.e. Flipper Zero drives the clock line  
- [ ] Drive clock at varying speeds as GBC supports
- [ ] Proper documentation
