# Notes for Haier TV Remote:

The part number on the Haier Remote is: 

### $$ \text{HTR-A18M} $$

There are 2 `.ir` files for my Haier TV:

- The `Htr_a18m_1.ir` file has only the major functions of the remote.
- The `Htr_a18m_2.ir` file is a complete remote copy with all functions as listed on the remote.
